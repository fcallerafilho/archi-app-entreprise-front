# Vehicule Sales Management Project

This project consists of a vehicle sales management platform, done for the subject "Architecture des applications en entreprise", at Polytech Marseille, 8th semester. It was done in collaboration with [Daniel Ven√¢ncio](https://github.com/DATVenancio) and [Dielson Soares](https://github.com/dielso).
This repository contains the front-end code of the application, done with Nuxt.js. The back-end uses Spring Boot Suite, which was the main competence to be developed during the subject. To find it's code, please refer to [VehicleManamegent](https://github.com/DATVenancio/VehicleManagement).

Instruction to run the project:
```
npm i
npm run dev
```

For the backend, you must have a MySql database that your are going to link to the Spring Boot code in the application.properties file. Once your username, password, and name of the chosen database are set in this file, everything is ready to run.
